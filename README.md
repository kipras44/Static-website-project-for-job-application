### Website for a fictional training portal

For this project, I used Figma for the first time to design the wireframe, and found out just how useful of a tool it is for a developer.
Although there is no functionality, as this wasn't part of my application criteria, there's potential for standard implementation of on hover elements, page transitions, and so on.
I did struggle to align some of the elements, and this project helped me work on my understanding of CSS flexbox.
